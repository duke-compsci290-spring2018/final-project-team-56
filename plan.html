      <h1>Final Project Plan</h1>
      <h2>Data Visualization in the Political Sphere</h2>
      <h3>Team 56: Harry Wang, Zuzu Tang</h3>

    <h3>Features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Data Analysis</li>
      <p>For this feature, we plan to do some exploratory data analysis such as basic summaries of the overall data that show distributions of the data. We will display basic plots along with some valuable statistics such as
    mean, median, and quartiles. This feature is a good introduction to the potential predictors that may influence a congressperson's reelection rate. The predictors we plan to explore include
      party alignment, gender, age, sources of donations, home state, and voter population characteristics. Here is a <a href="https://theunitedstates.io/congress-legislators/legislators-current.json">JSON file</a> with data about current US legislators
      that we will use. Here is some <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbouchet/congress-donations-to-isp">data</a> on which congresspeople received donations from ISPs.
      <br>
      Our website will use some original data sets regarding basic information on present day congresspeople. In addition, the user will be able to input their own dataset that our website will generate relevant graphics for.
    </p>
      <li>Data Visualization</li>
      <p>For this feature, we are planning to use the <a href="http://visjs.org/">VisJS</a> library to help with building an interactive and visual representation of the data. The user will have to specify which kind of visualization
      that they would want the app to run and the user will have to upload a correctly formatted dataset.</p>
      <li>Data Correlation</li>
      <p>This is a standard feature that would come with the overall data analysis. If a user would like to look at more specific correlation values between objects within the dataset, they would use this feature.</p>
    </ul>
    <h3>Technologies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://learnjsdata.com/">JSData</a></li>
      <p>This library will be used mainly to manipulate the datasets that we will upload and also run the basic data analysis on summaries of distributions within the dataset to other basic but not too complex data analysis and correlations.</p>
      <li><a href="http://visjs.org/">VisJS</a></li>
      <p>This library will be the primary source that our project will be based off of as we will probably use it to run most, if not all, of the interactive visualizations.</p>
      <li><a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue</a></li>
      <p>After learning how to Vue after these last two projects, we felt that Vue would be the perfect front-end development to build our application.</p>
      <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase</a></li>
      <p>Firebase would be the best option to preserve data and profiles of users/admins and would help with restricting user access given their privilege settings as well as just being a good all round database to hold datasets.</p>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/open-data/bulk-data">Open Secret's Bulk Data</a></li>
      <p>Open Secret will probably be our primary source of data as it holds the most data on members of congress as well as additional information such as their campaign finance data, lobbying data, and personal finance data. </p>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators">Members of United States Congress</a></li>
      <p>This github repo contains a maintained dataset of all member's of congress as well as their roles and affiliations and voting records.
      <li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com">Kaggle Datasets</a></li>
      <p>Kaggle just has a huge abundance of datasets on all sorts of topics - one that is particularly interesting was the donations from ISPs to congerssmen</p>
    </ul>
