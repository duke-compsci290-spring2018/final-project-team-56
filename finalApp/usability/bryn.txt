I registered as a user for this site and got to compare guest vs. user privileges. I like how the site could detect my location
so I didn't have to search for North Carolina to learn about the Congress members in my state. I also liked being able to have
ready access to each Congress members contact info, and then being able to add them to a database after. The database made
it easier to the information. The graphs were also pretty interesting because I've never seen anything represented with them
before. I didn't actually have any data to upload of my own.
