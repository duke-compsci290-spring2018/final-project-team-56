I really liked the use of the Google Maps API to show your current state. I also thought that having a list of favorite
Congressmen was also really useful and enjoyed the sorting capabilities within that. I think something they could have
fixed was adding some sort of add all the Congressmen in one state feature, so I wouldn't have to click through everyone.
The interactive ideology graphs were impressive, and I'd be interested in which library they used for that.
