Our plan for our application was to create a tool that could be used to hold datasets pertaining to politics and also to run basic graphs to try and find visual patterns among the data entries. We wanted it to be a tool that users can use to get more familiar with the political sphere. At the moment, users can use google location to find the members of congress within a given state or their current state. They can then add specific members to their favorites to keep track of them. Another introductory feature that we have open to all users of the app is a basic analysis of the political ideologies of the members of congress. Then, users and admins are able to upload their own dataset to and are able to plot different variables from their dataset to try and see if any variables are correlated.

Frameworks used:
Vue was definitely a framework we wanted to use especially as it was the most familiar one and would help us develop an application efficiently.
We used a combination of different libraries for data visualization and graphing because we both used different libraries when doing our explore projects and became familiar with our separate libraries. We tried our best to overlap where we could. The remaining packages that we used were because they had extensive documentation and were more maintained regularly: i.e. Google Maps API.
